Mistral LLM is a language model developed by Mistral AI. It is a large language model designed to understand and generate human-like text. LLM stands for "Large Language Model," indicating its size and capabilities.

Mistral 7B is a specific model within the Mistral LLM family. The "7B" refers to the number of parameters in the model, with larger numbers generally indicating more powerful and capable models. Mistral 7B is one of the latest models from Mistral AI and is designed to outperform the previous Llama 2 13B model on various benchmarks.

Mistral 7B is trained on a large amount of text data and can be used for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, question answering, language translation, and more. It is designed to understand and generate text in a way that is coherent and contextually relevant.

In this repository, we have used Mistral 7B to create a LLM chatbot:
